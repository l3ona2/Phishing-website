# Phishing-website-Detection
Identify and prevent phishing attacks with real-time URL analysis.
A phishing website detection application aims to identify malicious websites that attempt to deceive users into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. These applications leverage various techniques and machine learning models to analyze and determine whether a given URL is legitimate or potentially harmful. ### Key Characteristics of Phishing Websites

URL Deception:

Similar Domain Names: Phishing websites often use domain names that are very similar to legitimate sites, with slight variations (e.g., using numbers instead of letters, additional words, or different top-level domains like .com vs. .net).
Use of Subdomains: They might use subdomains to give the appearance of legitimacy (e.g., login.bank.example.com instead of bank.example.com).
Visual Imitation:

Design and Layout: Phishing sites often copy the design, logos, and overall layout of the legitimate websites they are impersonating.
Fake Forms: They include forms that ask for personal information such as login credentials, payment details, or social security numbers.
Insecure Connections:

Lack of HTTPS: While not always a sign of phishing, many phishing websites lack HTTPS encryption, making the connection insecure.
Suspicious Content:

Urgency and Threats: Phishing websites often contain urgent messages or threats (e.g., "Your account will be suspended unless you verify your information immediately").
Unusual Requests: They ask for information that legitimate websites typically wouldn't request, such as PIN numbers or full social security numbers via web forms.
Technical Indicators:

IP Address in URL: Legitimate websites usually have domain names, not IP addresses (e.g., http://192.168.1.1/login).
Poor Grammar and Spelling: Many phishing websites have spelling errors and poor grammar.
Techniques Used by Phishing Websites
Email Phishing: Sending fake emails that appear to come from trusted organizations, prompting users to click on a link that leads to a phishing website.
Spear Phishing: Targeting specific individuals or organizations with personalized messages to increase the likelihood of deceiving them.
Clone Phishing: Creating a nearly identical copy of a legitimate email that contains a link to the phishing website.
Website Redirection: Redirecting traffic from a legitimate website to a phishing site through malicious ads, compromised web pages, or shortened URLs.
Detection Techniques
To determine if a website is phishing, various detection techniques can be employed:

URL Analysis:

Check for suspicious patterns in the URL (e.g., excessive use of special characters, IP addresses, or unusual domains).
Content Analysis:

Analyze the website's content for phishing indicators such as urgent messages, requests for sensitive information, and inconsistencies in design.
Machine Learning Models:

Train models using features extracted from both phishing and legitimate websites to predict the likelihood of a site being phishing.
Database Comparison:

Compare the URL against known phishing databases like PhishTank and OpenPhish.
